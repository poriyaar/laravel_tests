# Beginner Laravel Project

This project is a basic Laravel application that I created as a learning exercise. It was developed using **Laravel 9** and reflects my initial steps in understanding the framework. Below are some details about the project:

## Project Overview

- This project serves as one of my first attempts at building an application with Laravel.
- It is a simple and beginner-level project where I experimented with various Laravel features.
- Note: I did not use **models** in this project, which is something I will address in future projects.

## Challenges Faced

- I was unable to successfully compile CSS and JavaScript files during the development process.
- The project lacks the structure and organization that more advanced Laravel projects would typically have.

## Future Improvements

- Utilizing **models** to create a better-organized application.
- Learning and implementing asset compilation for CSS and JavaScript using Laravel Mix or Vite.

## Final Note

While this project may not be perfect, it marks an important step in my journey to becoming proficient with Laravel. Feedback and suggestions are welcome as I continue to learn and grow.
